#### Changes from level 1
What's different from AddressBook-Level1:
* Support for storing address (`a/`) and tags (`t/`)
* Support for marking a contact detail as 'private' (`pa/`) (`pe/`) (`pp/`) 
* View details of a person (`view` : shows non-private details), (`viewall` : shows all details)

### Viewing help : `help`
Format: `help`

> Help is also shown if you enter an incorrect command e.g. `abcd`
 
### Adding a person: `add`
Adds a person to the address book<br>
Format: `add NAME [p]p/PHONE_NUMBER [p]e/EMAIL [p]a/BLOCK, STREET, UNIT, POSTAL_CODE [t/TAG]...` 
 
> Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters, items in `SQUARE_BRACKETS` are optional, 
> items with `...` after them can have multiple instances. Order of parameters are fixed. 
> 
> Put a `p` before the phone / email / address prefixes to mark it as `private`. `private` details can only
> be seen using the `viewall` command.
> 
> Persons can have any number of tags (including 0)

Examples: 
* `add John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@gmail.com a/block 123, street, #01-01, 123455`
